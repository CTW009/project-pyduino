serial communication expected format
	
	id will refer to a constant and known component that would be connected to the system.
	the value will refer to many things i.e.: angle of a servo, resistance value, or a distance from a sensor!

	id || value

	
	a problem will arise when we have these constant values and we have to address it. that being the pins and where they are plugged in to the system. 

	my idea is: 

	we initiate a setup sequence by typing a known value as our id ex: enter_setup, or 0000 as our trigger

	as a result we can keep our formatting scheme and add on a couple of things
	

	ex:  of our formatting 
		
		id || pin number || pin type (in|out) || type of pin (digital/analog)
			
			to exit we shall enter 0000 or exit_setup and we shall save this info into mem "every time we enter previous config needs to be deleted might cause some trouble"

	
	because of serial communication we can not be precise so we still need a way of getting precision like how we do when we are close to the hardware.

	we can do this by having a class dedicated to these components then switching them on and off but that will eat a decent chunk of or mem if I try to include as much as i can.... (possible limitation?)

	if we can match a known id in setup the cross match it with a class we should be able to create a method that will switch on and off as needed

	Ex: 
	
		we know the name servo when we create a new setup we look for id the id already exists if so we know its a strict component. 
		so we can take the given input to guide our way to make the component work!      (though now that I think of it we need more then one pin for some things need a rework if I am to continue)
